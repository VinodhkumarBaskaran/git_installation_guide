Setup the user name and email id -- Use BAsh not zsh command line
===================================================================
git config --global user.name "VinodhkumarBaskaran" -- github username
git config --global user.name "vinodhb95@gmail.com" -- github emailid

To clone (copy) the files from  GitHub to local
===================================================================
1. Create / select the folder where you to clone the files
2. Open terminal >> set the path to created/selected folder 
3. Go to GitHub >> select the Repo that you want to clone
4. Click on the Code
5. Copy the code from GitHub
6. In Terminal, enter git clone <Paste the copied path from github> , hit Enter


In Local, we are creating new files or made any changes in the existing
========================================================================

1. Changes will not be there in the github Repo
2. To check and confirm, Enter command "git status" and hit Enter
 Example:

 (base) Vinithas-Mac-mini:git_installation_guide vv$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   Git_install_step_for_mac.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        Git working guide

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

3. One can see two comment thrown by Git 
    3.1 : Changes not staged for commit --> Some changes made to exisiting file which is not commited to Repo
    3.2: Untracked files --> New files has been created

4. Now, we can add new file to remote
    4.1: Enter the command :  git add new_file_name 
    4.2: git add will push the file to staging area
    4.3: To push the file to Repo type git commit -m "Provide comment"
    4.4: git push origin main

5. Now, we can add modified file to remote
  5.1 : git add modified file
  5.2: git commit -m "Provide comment"
  5.3: git push origin main

6. To delete a file in remote, I deleted test.txt
  6.1: git status
  Example
  (base) Vinithas-Mac-mini:git_installation_guide vv$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        deleted:    test.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

  6.2: git add "Deleted file name with extension"
  6.3: git commit -m "Deleted the test.txt"
  6.4: git push origin main 


7. Remote/ Repo has new file (say committed by external user),
 Now how to bring those changes to local,
  7.1: If you clone, then it will clone entire data once again 
       but in local we already have all the data expect new data.
  7.2: git clone is not a options
  7.3: Use git pull --> pull only bring those file where changes are done
